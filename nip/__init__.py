"""NIP (NetVis Intelligence Platform) components.

These modules provide the "platform substrate" described in NIP_Roadmap:
- technique registry (self-describing recon primitives)
- event bus (publish/subscribe)

This repo intentionally keeps these components lightweight and in-process so the
coursework toolkit and the NetVis GUI can share them without extra services.
